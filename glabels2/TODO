Development plan
----------------
This development plan sets a specific set of milestones for future versions of glabels.


Goals for 2.2.x:

		-  Bugfixes

		-  Translations


Possible Goals for 2.3.x (current development branch):

		-  Undo, Redo capability

		-  Make text items rich.  I.e. allow multiple characteristics
		   to exist within a single object.

		-  Text effects.  (follow contour, non-rectangular text boxes,
	           ...)

		-  Ability to select/unselect individual records during a merge-print.

		-  Add additional "merge" backends.  Candidates include:
			generic XML
			freedb (CDDB) for CD labels
			gnome-db

		-  Printer calibration tool: a facility for tweaking output origin and
		   scale.  This should really be part of the underlying print system but
		   currently is not, so I may want to add the hack.

		-  Adjustable grid spacing.  Spacing of visible grid should be user
		   adjustable.  This grid spacing should be an integral multiple of
		   a finer invisible grid.  There should be a "snap to grid" toggle,
		   that causes all posistioning and sizing performed on the canvas
		   to snap to the closest grid.  The possible grid spacing should be
		   appropriate for the current units selected (e.g. .1 points, .01 mm,
		   1/64 inch, 0.001 inch).

		-  Allow for management of custom templates
		   (i.e. delete, rename, edit).
