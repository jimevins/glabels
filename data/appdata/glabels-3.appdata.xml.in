      gLabels is a program for creating labels and business cards. It is
      designed to work with various laser/ink-jet peel-off label and
      business card sheets that you'll find at most office supply stores.

      gLabels can be used to design address labels, name tags, price tags,
      cd/dvd labels, or just about anything else that is organized in a
      regular pattern on a sheet of paper. Labels (or cards) can contain
      text, images, lines, shapes, and barcodes. gLabels also includes a
      document-merge feature which lets you print a unique label for each
      record from an external data source, such as a CSV file or an
      Evolution address book.
