Brozkeff's fork information
===========================

This fork adds --collate (-a) flag to the glabels-3-batch binary because it is missing in the upstream version and it does not allow using this flag when using glabels for automation in scripts. 

Ubuntu 22.04 deb package compiled against older Debian's barcode library to keep EAN13 and other barcode support. May need to manually put the relevant libraries to /usr/local/lib, the package was not tested much on a default ubuntu install.
